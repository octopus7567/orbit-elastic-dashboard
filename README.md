## About

Elastic is a simple and modern FRC dashboard made by Nadav from FRC Team 353. It is meant to be used behind the glass as a competition driver dashboard, but it can also be used for testing. Some unique features include:
* Customizable color scheme with over 20 variants
* Subscription sharing to reduce bandwidth consumption
* Optimized camera streams which automatically deactivate when not in use
* Automatic height resizing to the FRC Driver Station

## Building

Elastic requires Flutter and platform-specific dependencies to run. See the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started) for installation instructions.

Once Flutter is installed, download the package dependencies by running the command:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

For debug testing, build and run the app by running the command:
```bash
flutter run -d <PLATFORM>
```

For a release build, run the command:
```bash
flutter build <PLATFORM>
```
* The output executable will be located in:
  * Windows: `<PROJECT DIR>/build/windows/x64/runner/Release`
  * MacOS: `<PROJECT DIR>/build/macos/Build/Products/Release`
  * Linux: `<PROJECT DIR>/build/linux/x64/release/bundle`
  * Web: `<PROJECT DIR>/build/web`
